To add a zoom-in animation on a marker during the transition from one image to another in a 360° viewer, you would need to use JavaScript in addition to HTML and CSS. Here's a basic example of how you might do this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        #viewer {
            width: 100%;
            height: 500px;
            position: relative;
        }
        .marker {
            position: absolute;
            width: 20px;
            height: 20px;
            background: red;
            border-radius: 50%;
            transform: scale(1);
            transition: transform 1s;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="viewer">
        <div id="marker" class="marker" style="top: 50%; left: 50%;"></div>
    </div>

    <button onclick="changeImage()">Change Image</button>

    <script>
        function changeImage() {
            // Change the image of the viewer here

            // Zoom in on the marker
            var marker = document.getElementById('marker');
            marker.style.transform = 'scale(2)';
            
            // After the transition, reset the scale and change the position of the marker
            setTimeout(function() {
                marker.style.transform = 'scale(1)';
                marker.style.top = Math.random() * 100 + '%';
                marker.style.left = Math.random() * 100 + '%';
            }, 1000);
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, when you click the "Change Image" button, the marker will zoom in (by increasing its scale), and after 1 second (the duration of the transition), it will zoom out and move to a random position.

Please note that this is a very basic example and might not work perfectly in a real 360° viewer. You would need to adjust the code according to your specific requirements and the library you're using for the 360° viewer.
